<h1>SIFIA - Simple Finance Automation</h1>
<p>This is a finance automation project which uses python as a technology.</p>
<p>Modules Used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Streamlit : Front-end of the app</li>
  <li>Pandas : Handling the bank statement uploaded (read-write operations)</li>
  <li>Plotly : Plotting graphs</li>
  <li>Other modules like json and os for small intermediate tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>This project basically takes the bank statement as an input and reads the content. Divides the content into credits and debits sections.
The main purpose of the project is to categorize the credits and debits. For example if there is a purchase of 2 items from two different e-commerce webites lets say amazon and filpkart,
but both are considered as shopping so, only for once we have to categorize them into shopping.
From now on whenever we upload a bank statement, amazon and flipkarts expenses will be categorized as shopping.</p>
